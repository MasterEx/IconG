in priority order:
 * connect the boxes with lines
 * check when a pressed button should be unset
 * fix entry value and slider
 * create a list with the order of the actions - should descern what buttons are input, what output and what is their role
 * exec the commands
 * go to the "invisible" by scrolling
 * use arrows to indicate more boxes
 * delete boxes by dragging them to a trash icon
 * zoom in/zoom out
 * test test test
 * more test
 * implement more features
 * reapeat two previous dots

Ideas:

A nice idea about zooming is to zoom between the fingers and not the whole screen!
Also zoom needs better "accuracy".
